1. $a = '1'; <br>
   - The variable $a is assigned the string value'1'.<br>
   - Value of $a: '1'<br>

2. $b = &$a;<br> 
   - The variable $b is assigned by reference to $a. This means $b is not just a copy of $a; instead, $b and $a now both point to the same memory location. Any change in $b will directly affect $a and vice versa.<br>
   - Value of $b: '1' (because $b is referencing $a)<br>

3. $b = "2$b";  <br>
   - The variable $b is now being reassigned to a new value. The new value is a string that begins with '2' and is followed by the current value of $b.<br>
   - Since $b is referencing $a, $b currently holds '1', so "2$b" becomes "21".<br>
   - Therefore, $b is now assigned the string "21".<br>
   - Because $b is a reference to $a, changing $b also changes $a to "21".<br>

Final Values:<br>
- Value of $a: "21"<br>
- Value of $b: "21"<br>

 Summary:<br>
Both $a and $b have the value "21" after the code is executed. This happens because $b was initially set as a reference to $a, so any change made to $b also updates $a.<br>
